## Hi

My name is Rafa≈Ç. I'm [Magento Certified Developer](https://u.magento.com/certification/directory/dev/36019/). I'm working with Magento 1 from more than 8 years and with Magento 2 from 2016. 
I'm specialized in backend performance improvements (profiling, database improvements). I have experience working with projects containing more than 500k products.

Good knowledge of :
* varnish 
* algolia
* server administration

In free time I like to play [boardgames](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/xjonc), snowboard and sail :)
